# DataLens

This repository contains my graded assignments from the Business Data Management course at IIT Madras Online Degree in Data Science. Each assignment includes a given dataset and a set of questions, which I have solved using Python. My solutions involve data analysis, visualization, and implementation of various data science techniques. The goal of this repository is to document my approach to solving these problems and provide reference code for similar tasks.
